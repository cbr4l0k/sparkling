# Fizzy Bot

Ok, I found [this cool app to self host better looking/working Kanban
app](https://www.fizzy.do/)... this is just a way for me to be able to use it
from my telegram whenever I'm not in my laptop.

I played with the source code to expose the right ports and mount the storage
to inspect the content. Currently I keep working to make in fit my usecases.

I don't want to add any licence to the folder, so just assume it's MIT or
something that let you do whatever you want with it. It's mainly Claude Code
generated; but, once in a while I do the changes if I have the time or if I
really wanna learn how to do something specific.
